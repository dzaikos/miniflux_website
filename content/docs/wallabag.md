[Wallabag](https://wallabag.org/) is a self-hosted application for saving web pages.

- The API URL is the root URL of your instance. For example, if you use the hosted version, the URL is: `https://app.wallabag.it/`.
- To create a new API client, go to the "API clients management" section and choose "Create a new client".
- If `Send only URL` is checked, Miniflux sends only the URL of the item being saved instead of the item's page body content.
