[Notion](https://notion.so/) is a freemium productivity and note-taking web application.

- To create a new API integration, go to `https://www.notion.so/my-integrations` and click on `New Integration`.
- Fill in all the required fields and select your board of choice.
- Once submitted, you will be redirected to the `Secret` tab on your integration page. Generate a secret, which will look like this: `secret_XXXXXXX`.
- Create a new page, then head to the `...` menu in the top-right corner.
- Scroll down to `Add Connections` and select the API integration created earlier.
- Again, click on `...` on the same page and then click on `Copy link`. You should have something like this: `https://www.notion.so/<user>/<page-name>-1429989fe8ac4effbc8f57f56486db54?pvs=4`. Your page ID will be this part: `1429989fe8ac4effbc8f57f56486db54`.
